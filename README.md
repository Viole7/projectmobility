# projectmobility

This project is initially dedicated to getting myself, ravenprocellous, and my partner out of our family's homes and set up in our car with a tent. We plan to travel from the East Coast to the West Coast, visiting wherever we plase and improving this project and others on the road.

Easily document through photos and blog our trip through the USA
Protect ourselves with sousveilance etc.
Develop a custom Linux environment for us
Develop a custom Android ROM
Keep track of expenses, revenue etc.
Foster a community of likeminded individuals who wish to live a more mobile life
Discover the best ways to make money while on the move
