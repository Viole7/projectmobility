This is a project started by ravenprocellous and

We believe that it is possible to live a completely nomadic lifestyle, earning money through tools on the internet, and keeping costs down with the help of technology. Our goal is to move from our current position of living with our family to living a mobile lifestyle that allows us to move from place to place while earning enough to fill the gas tank and our stomachs, all while learning about and testing the limits of humans in the 21st century.

Ideas to include:

List of costs and to-dos to keep track of and check off at we meet various goals
Easily document through photos and blog our trip through the USA
Protect ourselves with sousveilance etc.
Develop a custom Linux environment for us
Develop a custom Android ROM
Keep track of expenses, revenue etc.
Foster a community of likeminded individuals who wish to live a more mobile life
Discover the best ways to make money while on the move
